how to even do this

Drag and drop pieces to the bag.

The pieces should snap into place in the bag if they are within the boundaries, and snap back to their starting place if not.

"Snap into place"

simple case: 1x1 square. Find the center of the square. Find the grid square center that's closest. Move the square to that center.
harder case: 2x1 square. Where is the center? It has to be a center that wouldn't cause illegal placement.
even harder: E shaped tetromino. 

How to represent the bag grid

When we drop a piece in, we could mark the spaces that it occupies.

Or, we could keep track of how many pieces are still in the item tray. We only update that number when a piece is successfully placed.

numItemsLeft = x (count the nodes in level???)

onSuccessfulDrop{
	...
	numItemsLeft--;
}

Obvious exploit: successfully place the same piece over and over. Fix: maintain state for each piece.

Is this approach simpler than figuring out which spaces in the grid are occupied?

Is there just a simpler way to do this, or a simpler game that I can make?




Listen for collision with lid on both of the sensors
Create a sensor inside the box, add bool _inTheBox member var to Tile. Toggle based on collision with boxSensor




Advanced Topics in Objective C.

Singletons - share info across classes nicely
----------

@interface GameState : NSObject
+ (instancetype)sharedInstance;
@property(nonatomic, assign) NSInteger coins;
@end


[GameState sharedInstance].coins += 1;

Connecting Objects
------------------

One object can sign up for updated by another object

Example: multiple gameplay variations that use the same control
@interface NumberChooser : NSObject
@property (weak) Gameplay *gameplay;
@end

...
CCNode gameplay = (Gameplay*)[CCBReader load: @"gameplay"]
NumberChooser.gameplay = gameplay;
...

Notifications
-------------

Broadcast notification, subscribe, respond through NSNotificationCenter

Configuration Over Code
-----------------------

Store game content in xml, json, or .plist file
NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Statements" ofType: @"plist"];
_statements = [NSArray arrayWithContentsOfFile:path];

NSUserDefaults
--------------

Persist data between app sessions (not wiped until uninstalled)
synchronize forces a save (expensive call, but sometimes you need to make sure the data is saved)
Can only save NSObjects (NSIntegers, NSStrings, etc)
You can save all relevant game state into a NSDictionary, then persist that in NSUserDefaults

Organization
------------

#pragma mark - custom annotation that shows method dropdown
